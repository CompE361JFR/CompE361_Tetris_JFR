-Contains what we did on a particular day

Before Thanksgiving Break
- We met up as a group a couple times, brainstorming ideas on how to implement the project. We tried creating it with 
what Visual Studio came with, but this proved to be a challange. Fate found an article, where we can create a UWP game
using MonoGame, a software extension for Visual Studio. After agreeing to use this software we downloaded it and proceeded
to enjoy our break, while doing some work on the project individually.

Raven 
- I created a Sources file, README file, and this Logs file, for our team to be able to communicate through GitHub more, 
besides using text messages.
- I also found a video about adding a GitHub extension to Visual Studio. A link to this video can be found in the Sources file

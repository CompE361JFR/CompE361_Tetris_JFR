-Contains what we did on a particular day


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before Thanksgiving Break (November 14, November 19, November 20)
- We met up as a group a couple times, brainstorming ideas on how to implement the project. We tried creating it with 
what Visual Studio came with, but this proved to be a challange. Fate found an article, where we can create a UWP game
using MonoGame, a software extension for Visual Studio. After agreeing to use this software we downloaded it and proceeded
to enjoy our break, while doing some work on the project individually. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/28/18 
(Raven) 
- I created a Sources file, README file, and this Logs file, for our team to be able to communicate through GitHub more, 
besides using text messages.
- I also found a video about adding a GitHub extension to Visual Studio. A link to this video can be found in the Sources file
- (12:04 PM) Just downloaded the GitHub extension. Going to bed now. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/29/18
Class got canceled, so we met up, created our "Final Project Check" PDF, and we started planning how we will do the video, like discussing 
what software to use, what we are going to film, etc.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/30/18 

(Raven)
-I spent the day getting used to GitHub. I added a version of tetris game on this repository so that we can all edit it, instead of
creating local versions of our game, which we have been doing until this week. 
- I found a video on how to upload an existing project into a GitHub repository. A link can be found in the sources file. 

(Jayson)
- I am learning how to effectively use github, such as the commit/sync feature from the github extension we downloaded for visual
studio. I used the video Raven mentioned today to learn how to use this feature.
- I found a resource to teach me about forks in github so I can freely experiment with the project code/files without having to worry about
affecting the master repo. The resource can be found in Sources.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/1/18

(Fate)
- I have learned how to link Visual Studios to GitHub and was able to create a new repository in Visual Studios using the video Raven
uploaded on the file "Sources." And also learned how to fork a repo with Jayson's source.

(Raven)
- I found a source about how objects/sprites are drawn on top of each other. (You can view it in the Sources file under 12/1/18)
- In order to avoid certain blocks from overlapping one another, I've updated the code so that the falling block is drawn last.
  By doing so, the falling black will always be drawn on top of everything, so the weird overlapping won't happen unlike in 
  previous versions. 
- I've also updated the row deletion functionality of our game. It should now bring down every block down by one row, if the last row 
is filled. Once the row is cleared and every block is brought down, it increments the score by 119. 
- NOTE: This only applies to the last row! Should the player fill the 8th row for example, it will not clear the 8th row
  and it will not increment your score.
- Further development of this function will be needed, and will be done so on a different day. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/2/18
(Fate)
- I have created code for a new block for the game that is 1x3 and would look like this --- and it can be moved left and right.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/3/18
(Raven)
- I've updated our row deletion function. It should delete the row REGARDLESS of what row it is. Before it would work with the last row
  only. It should work with every row now.
- I've also did some housekeeping, like getting rid of old comments, and making the code more readable.

(Jayson)
-I added a simple pause feature to the game using conditional statements and a flag.

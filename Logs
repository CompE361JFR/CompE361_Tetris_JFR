-Contains what we did on a particular day


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before Thanksgiving Break (November 14, November 19, November 20)
- We met up as a group a couple times, brainstorming ideas on how to implement the project. We tried creating it with 
what Visual Studio came with, but this proved to be a challange. Fate found an article, where we can create a UWP game
using MonoGame, a software extension for Visual Studio. After agreeing to use this software we downloaded it and proceeded
to enjoy our break, while doing some work on the project individually. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/28/18 
(Raven) 
- I created a Sources file, README file, and this Logs file, for our team to be able to communicate through GitHub more, 
besides using text messages.
- I also found a video about adding a GitHub extension to Visual Studio. A link to this video can be found in the Sources file
- (12:04 PM) Just downloaded the GitHub extension. Going to bed now. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/29/18
Class got canceled, so we met up, created our "Final Project Check" PDF, and we started planning how we will do the video, like discussing 
what software to use, what we are going to film, etc.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/30/18 

(Raven)
-I spent the day getting used to GitHub. I added a version of tetris game on this repository so that we can all edit it, instead of
creating local versions of our game, which we have been doing until this week. 
- I found a video on how to upload an existing project into a GitHub repository. A link can be found in the sources file. 

(Jayson)
- I am learning how to effectively use github, such as the commit/sync feature from the github extension we downloaded for visual
studio. I used the video Raven mentioned today to learn how to use this feature.
- I found a resource to teach me about forks in github so I can freely experiment with the project code/files without having to worry about
affecting the master repo. The resource can be found in Sources.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/1/18

(Fate)
- I have learned how to link Visual Studios to GitHub and was able to create a new repository in Visual Studios using the video Raven
uploaded on the file "Sources." And also learned how to fork a repo with Jayson's source.

(Raven)
- I found a source about how objects/sprites are drawn on top of each other. (You can view it in the Sources file under 12/1/18)
- In order to avoid certain blocks from overlapping one another, I've updated the code so that the falling block is drawn last.
  By doing so, the falling black will always be drawn on top of everything, so the weird overlapping won't happen unlike in 
  previous versions. 
- I've also updated the row deletion functionality of our game. It should now bring down every block down by one row, if the last row 
is filled. Once the row is cleared and every block is brought down, it increments the score by 119. 
- NOTE: This only applies to the last row! Should the player fill the 8th row for example, it will not clear the 8th row
  and it will not increment your score.
- Further development of this function will be needed, and will be done so on a different day. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/2/18
(Fate)
- I have created code for a new block for the game that is 1x3 and would look like this --- and it can be moved left and right.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/3/18
(Raven)
- I've updated our row deletion function. It should delete the row REGARDLESS of what row it is. Before it would work with the last row
  only. It should work with every row now.
- I've also did some housekeeping, like getting rid of old comments, and making the code more readable.

(Jayson)
-I added a simple pause feature to the game using conditional statements and a flag.
-Trying to make the speed-up-falling mechanic less buggy by preventing it from being done when there is something in the way or when it
is at the bottom. Still buggy.

(Fate)
- I have fixed the bug for pressing  the key "P", which now allows the blocks to fall faster without exceeding the playing grid, however,
I still have to fix the blocks stopping when there is another block underneath. And the L block is still buggy and I still need to 
that. I'll be doing this tomorrow

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/4/18

- Today we spent the day trying to fix the errors between the versions of Tetris that we have been uploading. Sometimes GitHub would
  not let us commit our changes, because a team member has committed some changes before hand, therefore not allowing another team
  member to upload their work since their versions are different. 
  
  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/5/18

(Raven) 
- Just finished with having an event that would end the game, once once of the top rows have been filled. It has been uploaded.
  One thing to note, even though it stops the game, the user can still move the block using the "A" and "D" keys. Further debugging
  will be necessary to make this feature better. 
  
- I've seperated our main file into their own .cs file, each containing their own function, since the Game1.cs was getting quite large.
  This will help with the readability of our code. 
  
- I've also created another block, which is the vertical version of the "- - -" block. 

(Fate)
- I added a new block that would look like this:
  *
  * *
    *
  and added the moving features such as moving left and right and move down faster. I also fixed the bug we had whenever we would spam 
  "P". I also fixed the bug of the blocks to not go through other blocks whenever they move left or right. There are still
  bugs in the game that I need to fix but I will be doing so another day. I will also be adding a new block soon.
  
(Jayson)
- Today (Wednesday), I began work on the high score mechanic and a restart after game-over should the player want to play again. Both are still
  unfinished, as they are directly connected together.
- I originally wanted to implement the high scores by writing/reading them from a text file, but I ran into difficulties with access
  permissions on the file. The program apparently does not have access to the text file (regardless of where I put it). For now I have
  settled with using a list collection class.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/6/18

(Jayson)
- I spent my free time trying to debugging the reset and high score feature in my local repository/clone.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/8/18
(Fate)
 - Today, I will be creaing a 2x2 block and I will be fixixng the small errors again.
 - I finished creating the new orange 2x2 block, and I will be creating a new block soon which is the rotated version of the green block.
 which would look like this:
    * *
  * *
  - There was a glitch in our game where whenever a block is near another block beneath it, and when the block is right on top of
  another block and the user would still keep moving left/right, the top block would go through the block below. I have fixed 
  that glitch where the user can keep moving left/right even if the block is right on top of another block without letting it
  go through the bottom block.
  - The last bug for the game is just the L block, I will be fixing that soon

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/9/18
(Jayson)
- I spent some time continuing to debug the highscore feature. I think the issue is that it populates the highscore list infinitely
  until the game over flag is turned to false, which leads to the printed highscore board to have the same highscore printed in all the
  positions. Currently still working on it in my clone of the master branch and I will hopefully push my changes when it's properly
  debugged.
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/10/18
(Jayson)
- I figured why it was continously adding the score in every list index. I needed more conditionals/checks and a flag to designate
  if the score has already been added. This is required because the game is constantly updating itself every second, and so I needed to
  stop the input-highscore code from running if already put the score in. Other checks were put in for typical score-setting situations.
  It should now handle "normal" scores fine. One important thing to note is that it only saves the top three highscores in a current
  session. If you close the game and open it again, you'll see that the highscore board is once again empty.
- Next thing to work on is the restart feature. It is still unfinished and needs to be fully implemented and debugged. Currently the
  issue is that it is not clearing the board when "R" is pressed.
  
  (Fate)
  - Today,  I added three new blocks, which is the rotation and flips of the block Z. I will adding a few more blocks soon and fix 
  any more bugs. 
  
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  12/11/18
  
  (Raven)
  - Fixed the bug where the board would not clear when resetting the game. It should clear the board now, and the player can
    continue playing the game.
    NOTE - The row deletion function would sometimes work. Maybe because Fate added some more blocks, the code for the row deletion only 
    applied for the previous blocks instead of the new ones. I will debug this later today, or in the next couple days.
  
  (Jayson)
  - Fixed the bug where you can still move and hit pause when the game is over.
  - Worked with Raven to debug the board not clearing when reset is pressed.
  
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  12/16/18
  (Fate)
  I added a new block to the game in the shape of the letter T. 
  
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  12/17/18
  (Fate)
  Lastly, I added a menu where the user will be welcomed first. There are also rules shown in this menu
  letting the user know what keys to use for the game. 
  
  (Jayson)
  - I optimized the code for the pause feature by having it only check once instead of for each block.

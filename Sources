All the sources that we accessed and used throughout the development of this clone of Tetris

- Fate found this source before the start of Thanksgiving break. After finding it, we started using MonoGame, an extension of Visual Studio to help us program our game

Found a video about integrating GitHub with Visual Studio, so we don't have to constantly upload our versions of Tetris into GitHub.
Important Timestamps (Will be updated to have more timestamps of different topics) :
- 0:25 How to download the GitHub extension
- 1:50 Create a new repository from GitHub
- 3:28 The definitions of "Commit All", "Commit All and Push" and "Commit All and Synchronize"

I found a source where you can rotate a sprite. If we will have time we will be able to use this source as a reference to rotate 
our tetris blocks when a specific key is pressed.
